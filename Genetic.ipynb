    "<h2>Part 1: Genes and Chromosomes</h2>\n",
    "In this algorithm we have 3 different classes of data:<br>\n",
    "<li>Genome, which is the smallest and mine is each cell of the board.<br>\n",
    "<li>Chromosme, which is a cluster of genes together and mine is a 9 in 9 board.<br>\n",
    "<li>Population, which is a list of chromosmes and my population size is 200.<br></li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Genome</h2>\n",
    "<p>Each cell is a genome, in the algorithms mutation function we swap 2 genes in the same chromosome and in the cross over we swap a group of genes between two chromosomes.<br></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Chromosome</h2>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    Each chromosome is a possible solution to our problem.<br>\n",
    "    We can find out if a solution is found using a fitness function which is defined as follows:<br>\n",
    "    <li>Get the count of duplicate numbers in each column and divide them by (9*9)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Get the count of duplicate numbers in each 3by3 block and divide them by (9*9)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Check if there is any duplicates:\n",
    "        <li>If there isn't any: set fitness to 1 and return.\n",
    "        <li>If there is: return the multitude of block_sum and col_sum as fitness.\n",
    "    </li>    \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Population</h2>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    We have a ppulation size of 200. Initial population is generated randomly with the only two constraints of not having duplicated any of the fixed values in a block, row or column and not inputted more than 9 times.<br>\n",
    "    Each generation, we take 20% of the top(fittesst) chromosomes and keep them as elites in the next generation. Using these elites, we create children by randomly crossing over two of them and possibly mutating the child.<br>\n",
    "    <h4>Cross Over:</h4>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        A child is created using a cross over between two randomly selected chromosomes and then using two randomly generated cross over points, switched genes between these points in each row.\n",
    "        The aforementioned approach for cross over had some problems, only the elites had a chance to be a parent. This might cause the algorithm to get stuck in local minima. Thus a new approach is introduced:<br>\n",
    "        Have a competition between two randomly chosen chromosomes and give the weaker one a chance to be chosen reducing the chance for the population to go stale.<br>\n",
    "        Afterwards, the cross over is as follows:<br>\n",
    "    <li>Randomly choose two cross over point.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Apply cyclic cross over to rows from cross over point 1 to cross over point 2.</li>\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "    <h4>Mutation:</h4>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        In general, optimization solving algorithms converge to a local minimum.  To get out of this local minimum in a Genetic Algorithm, you can use mutations. The higher the mutation rate is, the more 'space' will be searched and the higher the chance that the global minimum is found. But if the mutation rate is too high, the algorithm won't converge anymore.<br>\n",
    "        The cross overed child is then mutated with an adaptive mutation rate which chaanges each time we encounter a successful mutation and resets each time we encounter stale population.<br>\n",
    "        Significant progress toward the fitness function's optimum, generally, can only happen in a narrow band of the mutation step size sigma. That narrow band is called evolution window.<br>\n",
    "        There are three well-known methods to adapt the mutation step size Ïƒ in evolution strategies:<br>\n",
    "            <li>(1/5-th) Success Rule</li>\n",
    "            <li>Self-Adaptation (for example through log-normal mutations)</li>\n",
    "            <li>Cumulative Step Size Adaptation (CSA)</li>\n",
    "    The evolution strategy utilized in this project is the 1/5-th success rule.<br>\n",
    "    <b>Note:</b> Eventually I didn't use this method since the initialization and cross over methods where enough for the algorithm to function correctly and it didn't change the runtime significantly.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "    <h4>Handling Stale Population:</h4>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        To detect a stale population, we have a counter which counts each time we see that the two best chromosomes have the same fitness. If this counter reaches 100, we reset the algorithm with new initial population and the base mutation rate.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
